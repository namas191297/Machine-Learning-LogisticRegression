Problem - We need to determine by asking the question that will user of specific age and earning some amount of salary specified in the record,
purchase a laptop or not. We implement a Logical Regression Model and use the independent variables to predict whether the parameters specified by
a user buys a laptop or not and see the accuracy and statistics for our model.

Dependencies used :

matplotlib - Used to plot the graph and show the regression line and the goodness of the fit.

pandas - Used to perform data operations and read information from the dataset.

numpy - General mathematical operations

Sklearn - To carry out operations on the data such as regression using the built-in functionalities.
